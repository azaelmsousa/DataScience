For example, influenza (AI) viruses agglutinate erythrocytes through the interaction of the virus surface glycoprotein, the hemagglutinin (HA), with receptors on the surface of the erythrocyte. Inhibition of the agglutination reaction by HA subtype-specific antisera is the basis of the hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assay." [VO:0000210]
